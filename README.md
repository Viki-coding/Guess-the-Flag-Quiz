<h2>Description - Project Purpose</h2>

The game is designed to give the user a fun interactive method to test their knowledge on flags and learn some new flags from countries across the world.  

The game is designed on one page, not cluttered, ensuring it is clear to the user the purpose of the game with intuitive features.  

It allows the user to initiate control, take an action and then displays the results of that action.  

It is obvious what the quiz is and how to play from the beginning.  

It is very easy to navigate through out.  It validates the action giving immediate feedback if the user choice is right or wrong. It is immediately evident what the quiz is and how to play it. It is fun, interactive, gives feedback with a nice predicable flow of information leading to the results page where they find out their score giving them the motivation to play again if they wish. 

<h2>User Demographics - Target audience</h2>
The target audience spans various ages and users, helping kids get to know their flags and testing adults on how many flags they really know!  A countries flag demonstrates strong emotive feelings and it is important to have respect for everyoneâ€™s background and heritage. Many younger people watching the Olympics saw how proud participating nations are when their athlete takes part, the use of supportive flags on victory laps and the rising of an athlete's flag during a medal presentation demonstrates how important the meaning of flags are to a nation and their people.  This quiz aims at being a fun, educational interactive quiz perfect for playing on your own, with family and friends or in a school setting.  The return user knows how easy it is to navigate and will enjoy trying to improve on their previous score.

<h2>UX</h2>

* Instructions of how to play
* Prompt the player on a clicking an answer
* Immediate feedback of whether an answer is correct or not.
* A tally of the score as they progress
* A display indicating which question they are on.
* Provide a final tally of their scores.
* Provide the opportunity to reset the game to have another go.

<h2>Design Choices</h2>
Colour Scheme
This is a fun, relaxing game for all the family, we choose calming green and pastel shades, we kept the design clean and uncluttered making it easy in intuitive to navigate. We choose I background images of globes.  We designed the container to be transparent so that the globe image can be gently seen through it.  We created a game logo in Canva in globe format with the world and some flags to encompass the meaning of the game. We kept the answer easily displayed on a clean pale background and kept the colour palette the same throughout the quiz.

Using a colour contrast checked we checked which font colours stood out best against our base colours.  All receiving good ratings. Graphic illustrated below:

<h2>Typography</h2>
We used the font Comic Neue which use a Sans Serif which is good for accessibility and is a dyslexia friendly font. We feel it looks fun and is clear and easy to read and adds a sense of fun to the quiz.

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
We created a wireframe using Balsamiq to plan out the structure and style of the app. We spoke with some potential users of the game during the testing phase to gain their insight and views. This was the beginning of our design journey, as we progressed with the design we made some changes to the actual page. During this planning phase we researched the fonts and background colours and text colours that would be most suitable and gained user feedback.

<h3>FEATURES</h3>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<b>The Instructions Button </b>
Once a mouse hovers over it turns to a hand cursor and enlarges the button to entice the user to click on it.  The instruction button is a clever toggle button feature that once clicked expands the full set of instructions.  When it is clicked again it reduces back, displaying a nice clean quiz area.

<b>Answer Options</b>
When the user moves their mouse across the potential answers the mouse cursor changes to a hand, indicating to the user that you click on your guess. Once an answer is clicked on and selected the user gets feedback that their answer has been registered and turns yellow, shortly after the guess will either turn red or green to let the user know whether their answer is right or wrong.  Shortly after the next flag and potential answers is loaded automatically reducing the amount of clicks a user has to do to progress through the game.

<h2>Interaction Points</h2>

The instructions can be revealed by clicking on the Instruction button, the user will be prompted by this when their mouse hovers over it - the button enlarges. They can click and toggle to open and close this feature. 

The user interacts with the quiz by visually looking at the flag, using their mouse the cursor changes to a hand when hovering over the potential answers giving them the feedback to choose one.  

Once an answer is clicked and selected the user gets feedback with the colour yellow that their click has been validated, promptly after this the selected answer will change colour again to let them know if the answer is right(green) or wrong (red). Promptly after that the next flag and answer options are introduced to keep a nice steady pace on the game. 

At the end of the quiz the users score is displayed with their incorrect/correct results and the user can click on the RESET button to load the quiz again. 


<h2>Future Implementation Section</h2>
The future of the flag quiz can be developed in multiple areas, such as:

* A drag and drop of the flag to the correct box would be fun to create and a nice user experience to keep them engaged.
* Have a larger section of flags from world using an API database.
* Have different choices of flags to choose from, European, Asia, South America, Africa etc.
* Have different levels of difficulty.
* Implement random order of potential answers.
* To every 1 correct answer have 10 incorrect for the data to be used from so the same countries are not always displayed with a particular flag.
* Create a leader board.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
Aria labels used to describe the content for screen readers and other accessibility tools. Colours are suitable for people who are colour blind and sans serif text suitable for people with dyslexia. We used coolers to ensure our background and contrast colours worked efficiently and clearly. We ran the site incognito and used Lighthouse to analyse the page with excellent results.  After running the site through lighthouse the first time we gained feedback that we could improve the accessibility by changing the background colour of instruction button so we did that which improved results.

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<u>Solved Bugs</u>

I came across many bugs while testing the quiz, from missing semi-colons to the reset button not being contained within the centre of the quiz box due to styling errors that were fixed and rectified. I put the HTML and CSS code through W3CValidator and fixed all warnings that were shown.  Having chrome development tool open while creating code and the console log was very helping with some aspects of the bug finding.  It was also helpful breaking down the problem and  thinking logically - whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s not to be able to focus in on the issue. 

One challenging bug was after creating the toggle button on the instructions button, when clicked was supposed to expand to display the entire instructions and when clicked again toggled back to the button.  It would take 2 clicks to get the instruction button to expand, after that it would only need one click to toggle. After searching on google for help, someone suggested changing the selectElementbyId rather than query.selector but that didn't work.  After some chatting with the Sean the CI tutor who told me javascript doesn't know the initial value of the style rules, so suggested using box display style and ternary rules to fix the problem.  W3 schools was good at explaining the process to take to fix it. Used the get computed style method, link in acknowledments below.  It was a very good learning experience and I was very happy to fix it! 

The question 1 of 5 bug was a good learning experience too teaching me the location of certain rules makes a huge difference to the way things are run.  The bug focused on the Question 1 of 5 process that was meant to increment by 1 each time we moved to the next question, but once I clicked and selected an answer the Question 1 of 5 would move to Question 2 of 5 but would not yet to have moved onto the next question.  I moved the code to a different location and it worked. 

Missing flags was down to typos in either the json file or the image file itself.

Two right answers was down to incorrect code in JS which we rectifed.
During testing we also observed some incorrect spelling of answer options, this was  good learning experience to test the content of json files also for errors like this and run it through a spell check to double check as well as visually checking.

<h2>User Experience Assurance</h2>
We want to ensure the end-user has a smooth experience and addressed any potential issues by testing and fixing any bugs on the site. Testing was on-going throughout the build. We used Chrome development tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we progressed. Each aspect of the quiz has been inspected using google chrome developer tools and Firefox inspector tool to ensure each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. We tested the site on the following devices: iPhone 12, a Samsung Galaxy tablet and MacBook Pro to view the site on various real time screen sizes. All tests responded and well with no bugs reported.
