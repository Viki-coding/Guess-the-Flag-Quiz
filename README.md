Design Choices
Color Scheme
We did some research to investigate the most popular computer games amounst this age group of males and females between the 12-16 age bracket. Fortnite was one of the most popular amoungst both sexes. We decided to use the Fortnite color scheme. We hope that this will invoke a sense of a challenge, a sense of belonging, a sense of fun.

We checked which font colors stood out best agaist these base colors. All receiving good ratings. Graphic illustrated below:

Typography
We used the font Comic Sans which use a Sans Serif which is good for accessibility and is a dyslexia friendly font. We feel it looks fun and is clear and easy to read.

Wireframes
We created a wireframe using Balsamiq to plan out the structure and style of the app. We spoke with the teachers and pupils to gain their insight and views. This was created for displaying the site on mobiles and larger screens such as tablets and desktops. This was the beginning of our design journey, as we progressed with the design we made some changes to the actual website. During this planning phase we researched the fonts and background colors and text colors that would be most suitable and gained user feedback.

FEATURES
Login In & Instructions Area
The Login and Instructions Area is a nice clear, easy to read set of instructions. The user is promoted to enter their first name into the value box as it has been pre-populated with the text 'Enter First Name'. Then the natural progression is to move down to click on the large bright START button under it. If the user has not entered a name they will be prompted to do so if they click on start without prepopulating the field.

Accessibility
Aria labels used to describe the content for screen readers and other accessibility tools. Colors suitable for people who are color blind and sans serif text suitable for people with dyslexia. We used coolers to ensure our background and contrast colors worked efficiently and clearly. After running our deployed site in incognito mode using Lighthouse we identified ?????

Quality Assurance
We took a systematic and structural approach to manually test each page to ensure it functions correctly and to help identify potential bugs. We created a specific testing template to ensure and re-check all pages were working correctly as specified with expected and actual outcomes using a methodical approach.

Test Evaluation Sheet:

As shown in the evaluation sheet above we navigated around our site and tested all available options to ensure they were working as intended, such as checking if a valid email address is entered and prompting the user if it is not, checking when we click on the Facebook icon, that it does in fact take us to a Facebook page and opens in a new page.

Lighthouse Testing
Incognito lighthouse testing was completed on all pages with excellent results ensuring optimal page loading times:

BUGS
Solved Bugs

User Experience Assurance
We want to ensure the end-user has a smooth experience and addressed any potential issues by testing and fixing any bugs on the site. Testing was on-going throughout the build. We used Chrome development tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we progressed. Each page has been inspected using google chrome developer tools and Firefox inspector tool to ensure each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. We tested the site on the following devices: apple iPhone 12 mini mobile phone, a Samsung Galaxy tablet and MacBook Pro for testing the site on various real time screen sizes. All tests responded and well with no bugs reported.

We gained some inspiration from the CI instruction videos for the 'Love Maths' site.

We got help with the READ.me by watching the video 'Creating your first README with Kera Cudmore' on CI Chanel Lead Library on YouTube and also the video with Lane-Sawyer Thompson on CI Channel on YouTube. Thanks to the on-line tutors, Ray, Gemma, Roo and Alan for their expertise and ability to explain some of the 'challenges' we encountered. Thanks our very supportive and positive facilitator Laura Maycock and my Kiwi mentor Dick Vlaanderen. Also found the webinar 'Community Q&A: How to Troubleshoot with Lane-Sawyer Thompson' very helpful approach to how to view looking at the site for bugs and methodically identifying issues.

CONTENT The content text for Dungarvan Health Clinic is fictious and is written by Viki Mulhall. The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome.
