Design Choices
Color Scheme
This is a fun, relaxing game for all the family, we choose calming green and pastel shades, we kept the design clean and uncluttered making it easy in insuative to navigate. 

Using a color contrast checked we checked which font colors stood out best against our base colors.  All receiving good ratings. Graphic illustrated below:

Typography
We used the font Comic Neue which use a Sans Serif which is good for accessibility and is a dyslexia friendly font. We feel it looks fun and is clear and easy to read and add a sense of fun to the quiz.

Wireframes
We created a wireframe using Balsamiq to plan out the structure and style of the app. We spoke with some potenital users of the game during the testing pase to gain their insight and views. This was the beginning of our design journey, as we progressed with the design we made some changes to the actual page. During this planning phase we researched the fonts and background colors and text colors that would be most suitable and gained user feedback.

Interaction Points
The user interacts with the quiz by visually looking at the flag, using their mouse the cursor changes to a hand when hovering over the potential answers giving them the feedback to choose one.  Once an answer is clicked the user gets feedback with a color change that it is selected and then another color change to let them know if the answer is right(green) or wrong (red). Then the next flag and answer options are introduced to keep a nice steady pace on the game. At the end of the quiz the users score is displayed with their incorrect/correct results and the user can click on the RESET button to load the quiz again.

We gained some inspiration from the CI instruction videos for the 'Love Maths' site.

We got help with the READ.me by watching the video 'Creating your first README with Kera Cudmore' on CI Chanel Lead Library on YouTube and also the video with Lane-Sawyer Thompson on CI Channel on YouTube. Thanks to the on-line tutor, Tom and Sean for their expertise and ability to explain some of the 'challenges' I encountered. Thanks our very supportive and positive facilitator Laura Maycock and our new facilator Kay and my Kiwi mentor Dick Vlaanderen. Also found the webinar 'Community Q&A: How to Troubleshoot with Lane-Sawyer Thompson' very helpful approach to how to view looking at the site for bugs and methodically identifying issues.
