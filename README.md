<h2>Description - Project Purpose</h2>
The game is designed to give the user a fun interactive method to test their knowledge on flags and learn some new flags from countries across the world.

<h2>User Demographics - Target audience</h2>
The target audience spans various ages and users, helping kids get to know their flags and testing adults on how many flags they really know.  A countries flag demonstrates strong emotive feelings and it is important to have respect for everyoneâ€™s background and heritage. Many younger people watching the Olympics saw how proud participating nations are when their athlete takes part, the use of supportive flags on victory laps and the rising of an athlete's flag during a medal presentation demonstrates how important the meaning of flags are to a nation and their people.  This quiz aims at being a fun, educational interactive quiz within a family setting or in school.  The return user knows how easy it is to navigage and will enjoy trying to improve on their previous score.

<h2>UX</h2>
Site Goals: First Time users will find the site intuitive and easy to navigate. The site provides the user with what they expect:

* Instructions of how to play
* Prompt the player on a clicking an answer
* Immediate feedback of whether an answer is correct or not.

* Provide a final tally of score.
* Provide the opportunity to reset the game to have another go.
  



<h2>USER STORIES</h2>
As a user I want to log into the game easily and view what I need to do easily and quickly without having to signup.  As a user I want to visually see the flags and answers clearly, to understand that the mouse cursor changes when I hover over and answer giving me feedback that I need to click on my guess.  As a user when I click I want to get an indicating if my choice has registered by changing colour and I want instant feedback whether my chosen guess is correct or not.  As I user I would like a challenge and the ability to play again to improve my score. As a user I would like to see my correct scores tally up.  As a user I would like the quiz to be fun, interactive, challenging and quick.  As a user I would like to play this game with friends and family to compare scores with each other to have some fun.

<h2>Typography</h2>
We used the font Comic Neue which use a Sans Serif which is good for accessibility and is a dyslexia friendly font. We feel it looks fun and is clear and easy to read and add a sense of fun to the quiz.

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
We created a wireframe using Balsamiq to plan out the structure and style of the app. We spoke with some potential users of the game during the testing phase to gain their insight and views. This was the beginning of our design journey, as we progressed with the design we made some changes to the actual page. During this planning phase we researched the fonts and background colours and text colours that would be most suitable and gained user feedback.

<h2>Interaction Points</h2>
The user interacts with the quiz by visually looking at the flag, using their mouse the cursor changes to a hand when hovering over the potential answers giving them the feedback to choose one.  Once an answer is clicked the user gets feedback with a colour change that it is selected and then another colour change to let them know if the answer is right(green) or wrong (red). Then the next flag and answer options are introduced to keep a nice steady pace on the game. At the end of the quiz the users score is displayed with their incorrect/correct results and the user can click on the RESET button to load the quiz again. 

<h2>Future Implementation Section</h2>
 * A drag and drop of the flag to the correct box would be fun to create and a nice user experience to keep them engaged.
 * Have a larger section of flags from world using an API database.
 * Have different choices of flags to choose from, European, Asia etc.
 * Have different levels of difficulty.


<h2>Accessibility</h2>
Aria labels used to describe the content for screen readers and other accessibility tools. Colours are suitable for people who are colour blind and sans serif text suitable for people with dyslexia. We used coolers to ensure our background and contrast colours worked efficiently and clearly. After running our deployed site in incognito mode using Lighthouse we identified ?????

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<u>Solved Bugs</u>
I came accross many bugs while testing the quiz, from missing semi-colons to the reset button not being contained within the centre of the quiz box due to styling errors that were fixed and rectified. I put the HTML and CSS code through W3CValidator.  


<h2>User Experience Assurance</h2>
We want to ensure the end-user has a smooth experience and addressed any potential issues by testing and fixing any bugs on the site. Testing was on-going throughout the build. We used Chrome development tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we progressed. Each page has been inspected using google chrome developer tools and Firefox inspector tool to ensure each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. We tested the site on the following devices: apple iPhone 12 mini mobile phone, a Samsung Galaxy tablet and MacBook Pro for testing the site on various real time screen sizes. All tests responded and well with no bugs reported.

<h2>Deployment Steps</h2>
* The site is Deployed using GitHub Pages
* Login to GitHub
* Go to the projects repository (https://viki-coding.github.io/Guess-the-Flag-Quiz/)
* Click on Settings
* Select pages in the left navigation bar
* From SOURCE dropdown select Deploy from a Branch
* Under BRANCH from dropdown select Main Branch and SAVE
* The site is now deployed but may take a few minutes to go live.
* Return to CODE tab of Github repo and wait a few minutes for build to finish, refresh page. This will show on GitHub-pages to see active deployments.

<h2>How to Fork</h2>
* Login to Github
* Go to Project repository
* Click the FORK button top right corner

<h2>How to Clone</h2>
* Log into Github
* Go to project repository
* Click on the code button, select what want to clone HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link.
* Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory
* Copy 'git clone' into the terminal and paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

We gained some inspiration from the CI instruction videos for the 'Love Maths' site.

We gained inspiration with the READ.me by watching the video 'Creating your first README with Kera Cudmore' on CI Chanel Lead Library on YouTube and also the video with Lane-Sawyer Thompson on CI Channel on YouTube. Thanks to the on-line tutor, Tom and Sean for their expertise and ability to explain some of the 'challenges' I encountered. Thanks our very supportive and positive facilitator Laura Maycock and our new facilitator Kay and my Kiwi mentor Dick Vlaanderen. Also found the webinar 'Community Q&A: How to Troubleshoot with Lane-Sawyer Thompson' very helpful approach to how to view looking at the site for bugs and methodically identifying issues.
